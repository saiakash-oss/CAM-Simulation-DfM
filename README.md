# CAM-Simulation-DfM
Analyzed an aluminum aerospace component for manufacturability, redesigning features like T-slots to simplify production. Developed a complete 3-axis CAM simulation in Siemens NX, optimizing toolpaths to reduce total machining time by 35% (from 7m 34s to 4m 53s) and decrease setups from 5 to 3. Tools: Siemens NX, CAM Simulation.
